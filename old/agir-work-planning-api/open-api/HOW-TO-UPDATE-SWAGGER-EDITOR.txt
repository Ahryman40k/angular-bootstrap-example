Download the latest version from Github directly :
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor

Only keep those files/folders :

open-api/swagger-editor/index.html
open-api/swagger-editor/dist
open-api/swagger-editor/LICENSE

You should also have a look at the "open-api/openApiConfigurer.ts" file : you'll see that
a workaround is used to make Swagger-Editor save the specs file *to the server* instead
of simply using the browser's localStorage! This is currently not supported
out-of-the-box! https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1241
